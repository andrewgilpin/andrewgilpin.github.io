This is the readme for my codeLouisville FEWD project.

I have taken skills from my current position and applied them to the skillset that I have picked up in the FEWD course.

This is a how-to as well as a command generator to assist in tracing out and troubleshooting an MPLS path

Examples for the input fields can be found in the page itself :)

Testing the commit and upload from terminal...
