## Description
```
This is the readme for my code Louisville FEWD project.

I have taken skills from my current position and applied them to the skillset that I have picked up in the FEWD course.

This is a how-to, as well as a command generator to assist in tracing out and troubleshooting an MPLS path

Examples for the input fields can be found in the page itself so that the commands will be complete. :)

## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. .coolbutton
This class makes my buttons look great!

2. .main-header
This class makes my header look great!

```



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. I have multiple functions created for each command that can be generated using the buttons.
I also used onClick functions to get the desired results.
Each button uses JavaScript function to concatinate the input from the user to the correct position in the command structure so that there are no mix-ups in how the syntax is handled.

```
